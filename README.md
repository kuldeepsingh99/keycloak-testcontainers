## Keycloak Testcontainer: What Is It and Why Use It?
Keycloak Testcontainer is a great tool for performing integration tests involving Keycloak (or other authentication systems) in your application. It's a Testcontainer for Keycloak that allows you to spin up a real Keycloak server inside a Docker container during your tests. This is useful when you want to perform real integration tests that mimic how Keycloak would behave in production, but without the need to manually set up and tear down the Keycloak instance.

### Why Use Keycloak Testcontainer?
- **Realistic Testing**
  - Since you are using an actual Keycloak server (instead of mocking it), you’re testing with the same configuration that would run in production.

- **Automated Setup and Teardown:**
  - You don’t need to manually manage a Keycloak instance. Testcontainers automatically handles starting and stopping the Keycloak server for each test run.

- **Isolation:**
  - Keycloak runs in a separate container, so tests are isolated from your local environment. This helps ensure consistency across different environments.

- **Easy to Integrate:**

  - You can easily use it in your Spring Boot integration tests, and it can be automatically started and stopped within the test lifecycle.
